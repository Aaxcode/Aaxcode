## Laxman Aale -- Software Developer

- Targeting Full-Stack, Front-end, or Back-end roles

My name is Laxman Aale, and I'm a software developer looking for job opportunities. I really enjoy coding and creating applications. My main focus is on using Java and Spring Boot, which I find really interesting.

Although I haven't worked on any specific projects yet, I'm excited to learn and gain experience in a real-world environment. I'm always keen to explore new technologies and improve my skills.

I'm someone who enjoys collaborating with others to achieve great results. If you know of any opportunities where I can contribute and grow, I would love to hear about them!

HTML | CSS | Java | Spring Boot | MySQL
